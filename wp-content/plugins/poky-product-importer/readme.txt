== How it Works ==
Fast and simple
You have 3 option on POKY dashboard
Option 1: for importing products from Shopify stores One by One (you need just to put the link of the product and click on import)
Option 1: for importing bulk products from any Shopify store (you need just to put the link of the store and click on load product - after that select products that you want to import and click on import)
Option 3: is for multi platforms (Here you need to use our chrome extension to import from all supported platforms)

== POKY works with a 3rd Party ==
POKY is an app for importing products from multi-platforms to WooCommerce stores
So in this part, we're using WooCommerce API
in your first entry to POKY Dashboard, we will redirect you to the WooCommerce panel to give us an Authorization
With this authorization, POKY will import the products you want directly into your WooCommerce store (this authorization includes reading and writing products)
You can read all information about WooCommerce API from here <a href="https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-rest-api/" target="_blank">WooCommerce API</a>.
This is terms & Conditions of WooCommerce <a href="https://woocommerce.com/terms-conditions/" target="_blank">Terms & Conditions</a>.

= Note =
By installing this plugin you agree to accept POKY <a href="https://poky.app/terms" target="_blank">Terms of Use</a>.
